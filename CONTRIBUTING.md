Howdy!

So, you're interested in contributing to Real World DAP project? 🤔

Perhaps you're confused as to where to start, or you believe your coding skills aren't "good enough"? Don't worry if you are here then you have what it takes to contribute.

Here are some ways you can contribute to the Real World DAP project:

- Spread the word! Blog, post, chat about the project to gather contributers should be well rounded:
  - **Home Buyers** ➡️ these will be the users of the platform who will help guide our requirments & provide feedback loops
  - **Bloggers** ➡️ aka messenger birds - discuss our project vision and attracting more contributers
  - **Architects** ➡️ build and maintain hardware/cloud architecture for development
  - **Developers/Data Engineers** ➡️ create scipts, databases, pipelines, tech specs, etc 
  - **Data Scientists** ➡️ analyze, process, and model data within the datamart & much more
  - **Others** ➡️ really anyone who has interest, input, or feedback is welcome to join project discussions
- Discover new data sources containing parcel data at the county and/or state levels 🤓
- Add personal research (i.e. links, best practices, ideas) to the discussion board 📚
- Create documentation (very important! We would be eternally grateful)
- Fix bugs submitted via GitHub issues (we can support you in this 😊)
- Refactor the code base 🥺

If these sound hard, do not worry! This document will walk you through exactly how to achieve any of these. <br/>
Also, your name will be added to rDAP's contributors list, and we'll be eternally grateful! 🙏
