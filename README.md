<h1> 🌎 RealWorld Data Analytics Platform (rDAP) </h1>


<h2> Overview </h2>
The **RealWorld Data Analytics Platform (rDAP)** is a data services framework using modern application development practices to deliver advanced real estate data to a core data mart which combines/overlaps GIS sources, government agencies, Realestate websites, and public records. 

<h2> What's the "Big Idea"? </h2>
The "BIG" idea is to develop a data source containg layered collections of Geographic Information [(GIS)](https://github.com/sshuair/awesome-gis) data with other public records (i.e. [county appraiser](https://downloads.hcpafl.org) , or [clerk of court](https://www.hillsclerk.com/Additional-Services/Official-Records), etc) so that devs, BI guys, and data scienctists can do their magic! <br/>
All contributers must work to **improve** and/or **automate** most of these proccesses:<br/>

- Gather source data 📝 
- Map data elements from source 🗺️ 
- Buid flexible code for reusability ♻️📜 
- Incorporate Test (automated?) scripts at key steps 🔍
- Develop with End User in mind 🤷‍♂️
- Ask questions and collaborate 🧑‍🤝‍🧑


<h2> But Why, tho? </h2>
Purchasing a home, for most people, is the single largest financial decision of their life. Sadly, real estate "buyers" make their decisions based only on the **LIMITED** data exposed to them from simple search filters or after an open house. And even for "buyers" who want to do **thorough** research, the data points they want are often isolated and require experience with APIs, Databases, Webs Scraping, or ETL/ELT to extract it.</br>
However, I believe truely suffecient data should be easyily accessible and curated into one platform for all "buyers" in order to make a more informed purchasing decision.<br/><br/>


<h2> Who can Contribute and How </h2>
 There are many types of "contributers" needed for this project, including those with experience as:
  - **Home Buyers** ➡️ these will be the users of the platform who will help guide our requirments & provide feedback loops
  - **Bloggers** ➡️ aka messenger birds - discuss our project vision and attracting more contributers
  - **Architects** ➡️ build and maintain hardware/cloud architecture for development
  - **Data Engineers/Developers** ➡️ create scipts, databases, pipelines, etc... per discussions/user feedback
  - **Data Scientists** ➡️ analyze, process, and model data within the datamart & much more
  - **Consultants** ➡️ data conultants can be helpful for discussing best practices, improvements, and general advice
  - **Others** ➡️ really anyone who has interest, input, or feedback is welcome to join project discussions
