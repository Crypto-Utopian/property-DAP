# property-DAP

<h3> Overview </h3>
The Property Data Analytics Platform (pDAP) is a currated data repo for property info/metrics from multiple data sources. <br/>

<h3> What's the "Big Idea"? </h3>
The "Idea" is to layer collections of Geographic Information (GIS) data with other public records (i.e. <u>[county appraiser](https://downloads.hcpafl.org)</u>, <u>[clerk of court](https://www.hillsclerk.com/Additional-Services/Official-Records)</u>, etc) so devs, BI guys, and data scienctists can do their magic! <br/>
The ultimate goal is to enhance and/or (semi~)automate the proccess of:<br/>
<p>
  <list>
    <li>(1) Gathering source data </li>
    <li>(2) Mapping data elements from source</li>
    <li>(3) Buiding flexible code for reusability</li>
    <li>(4) Incorporating validation (automated?) scripts at key steps/events </li>
    <li>(5) Develop with End User in mind </li>
    <li>(6) Ask questions and collaborate</li>
  </list>
</p>



<h3> But Why, tho? </h3>
Purchasing a home, for most people, is the single biggest financial decision of their life. So muchBy layering collections of Geographic Information (GIS) data with other public records (i.e. county appraiser, clerk of court, etc)  <br/>
users will have the tools needed to make more informed decesions.
