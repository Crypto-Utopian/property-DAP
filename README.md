# property-DAP

<h3> Overview </h3>
The Property Data Analytics Platform (pDAP) repo contains a framework to build & maintain an advanced Real Estate data mart comprised of data ingested from GIS sources, government agencies, Realestate websites, and public records.

<h3> What's the "Big Idea"? </h3>
The basic idea develope a data source containg layered collections of Geographic Information [(GIS)](https://github.com/sshuair/awesome-gis) data with other public records (i.e. [county appraiser](https://downloads.hcpafl.org) , or [clerk of court](https://www.hillsclerk.com/Additional-Services/Official-Records), etc) so that devs, BI guys, and data scienctists can do their magic! <br/>
All contributers must work to **improve** and/or **automate** most of these proccesses:<br/>

- Gather source data 📝 
- Map data elements from source 🗺️ 
- Buid flexible code for reusability ♻️ 
- Incorporate Test (automated?) scripts at key steps 🔍
- Develop with End User in mind 🤷‍♂️
- Ask questions and collaborate 🧑‍🤝‍🧑


<h3> But Why, tho? </h3>
Purchasing a home, for most people, is the single largest financial decision of their life. Sadly, real estate "buyers" make their decisions based only on the **LIMITED** data exposed to them from simple search filters or after an open house. And even for "buyers" who want to do **thorough** research, the data points they want are often isolated and require experience with APIs, Databases, Webs Scraping, or ETL/ELT to extract it.</br>
However, I believe truely suffecient data should be easyily accessible and curated into one platform for all "buyers" in order to make a more informed purchasing decision.
